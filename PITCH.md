## Q&A Preparation

### "How do you ensure your own biases don't affect the analysis?"

We've designed our system to rely on objective metrics and multiple AI models to reduce potential bias. Our political spectrum analysis uses standardized frameworks, and we provide transparent reasoning for all assessments.

### "How does this differ from existing fact-checking websites?"

Unlike traditional fact-checkers that require manual review by journalists, our solution:

1. Provides instant analysis of any article
2. Evaluates multiple dimensions beyond just factuality
3. Offers granular entity-level sentiment analysis
4. Presents information on a spectrum rather than binary assessments

### "What about articles behind paywalls?"

We're exploring partnerships with publishers to enable analysis while respecting their content restrictions. For now, our tool works with any freely accessible article.

### "How accurate is your AI analysis?"

Our system combines multiple AI models and verification methods to achieve high accuracy. We're transparent about confidence levels and provide supporting evidence for all claims.

### "What's your business model?"

We envision a freemium approach where basic analysis is free for all users, with premium features available to subscribers. We're also exploring educational institution partnerships.
